# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

We were tasked with creating a command-line application that takes in uswer input to generate a logo and save it as a SVG file. The uswer was a asked a variety of questions. These questions included the color of the text and the shape, a combination of 3 characters, and lastly a choice between a Circle, Square, and Triangle. Once all of those questions were answered a shape.svg file would then be created.
